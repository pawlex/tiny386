# Tiny386

> **Fork note.** This fork additionally targets the i386 emulator at a
> **VexRiscv soft core on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA**, as the CPU for a PC
> motherboard project — running slowly but observably, in both simulation
> and hardware, with guest memory in FPGA external memory behind an
> L2/L3 cache and coherency block. Upstream behaviour as a host
> application is unchanged. See **[FPGA-SOFTCORE.md](FPGA-SOFTCORE.md)**.

## Introduction
Tiny386 is a x86 PC emulator written in C99. The highlight of the project is its portability. It now boots Windows 9x/NT on MCU such as ESP32-S3.

The core of the project is a built-from-scratch, simple and stupid i386 cpu emulator. Some features are missing, e.g. debugging, hardware tasking and some permission checks, but it should be able to run most 16/32 bit softwares. To boot modern linux kernel and windows, some 486 and 586 instrutions are added. The cpu emulator is kept in ~6K LOC. There is also an optional x87 fpu emulator.

To assemble a complete PC system, we have ported many peripherals from TinyEMU and QEMU, it now includes:
 - 8259 PIC
 - 8254 PIT
 - 8042 Keyboard Controller
 - CMOS RTC
 - ISA VGA with Bochs VBE
 - IDE Disk Controller
 - NE2000 ISA Network Card
 - 8257 ISA DMA
 - PC Speaker
 - Adlib OPL2
 - SoundBlaster 16

For firmwares, the BIOS/VGABIOS comes from seabios. Tiny386 also supports booting linux kernel directly, without traditional BIOS. The idea comes from JSLinux, and it uses a small stub code called linuxstart.

## Demo
See [here](https://hchunhui.github.io/tiny386)

## Build
Linux: You need to install `SDL1.2` or `sdl12-compat` first, then type `make`.

For other platforms, please refer to `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

Pre-built binaries: [here](https://github.com/hchunhui/tiny386/releases)

## Usage

- Prepare an ini file
```ini
[pc]
; set path to BIOS and VGA BIOS
bios = bios.bin
vga_bios = vgabios.bin

; set memory size and VGA memory size
mem_size = 32M
vga_mem_size = 2M

; fda/fdb for floppy disks (optional)
fda = floppy.img

; hda/hdb/hdc/hdd for hard disks (optional)
; cda/cdb/cdc/cdd for CD-ROM disks (optional)
hda = win95.img
cdb = win95_cd.iso

; "fill_cmos" fixes "MS-DOS compatibility mode" in win9x, but it breaks winNT...
fill_cmos = 1

[display]
width = 720
height = 480

[cpu]
; gen = 3/4/5, for 386/486/586
gen = 3
; fpu = 0/1, to disable/enable x87
fpu = 0
```
- Run
```sh
./tiny386 config.ini
```

## ESP32 port
Currently the only supported target is the JC3248W535 dev board. The supported ESP-IDF version is v5.2.x.

### Build and Flash
You can find the pre-built flash image `esp/flash_image_JC3248W535.bin` from [here](https://github.com/hchunhui/tiny386/releases).
The pre-built image can be flashed directly at offset 0.

To build and flash manually:
```sh
scripts/build.sh patch_idf  # apply patches to ESP-IDF
cd esp
idf.py build
idf.py flash
```

### Configure
All files should be put in a SD card with FAT/exFAT file system. The ini file should be `tiny386.ini` and put in the root directory.
Please refer to `esp/tiny386.ini`.

### Keyboard/Mouse Input
There is no input device on the dev board, so currently `wifikbd` is used to forward keyboard/mouse events to the dev board over WIFI:
```
(EEP32-S3 board: listen on TCP port 9999) <--- WIFI ---> AP <--- WIFI/Wire ---> (PC: ./wifikbd esp_board_addr 9999)
```
